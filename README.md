# SnakeGame
The good old snake game which I made to understand OOP, mainly inheritance and  function overriding and other interesting things. Pygame is used in it...

Its one of those projects of mine through which I learned pygame

No design language is used in it, it's written in pure python.

**************IMPORTANT*******************
- In order to run this game you need to install latest pygame module
- To install pygame open CMD with administrator privilages and run command:
  >pip install pygame
- If there is any error like pip is not recognized, then make sure to add it in system environment variables

Keep learning, Keep coding

Thankies :D
